# Hello there, I'm Carter Clifford! üëã

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm a recent grad from Saskpolytech's Interactive Design and Technology program, and I've got a serious passion for coding, hockey, and video games.

## What I'm Up To üíª

I'm currently on the hunt for my dream job as a front-end developer, but in the meantime I'm keeping myself busy by working on some personal coding projects. Currently, im trying to further understand the React library!

## What I Know üß†

I've got experience with all sorts of web development tools and technologies, including:

- HTML & CSS (of course)
- JavaScript (With a touch of jQuery, too)
- PHP (For WordPress plugins)
- React (My fav library)
- Markdown (for all my fancy README needs)
- Git (because version control is life)
- mySQL (for all my database-y needs)
- Bootstrap (when I'm feeling lazy)

## Let's Connect! ü§ù

I'm always on the lookout for new coding buddies, hockey fans, or fellow gamers to chat with. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterlc/), or visit my personal [Website](https://carterlc.ca/).
